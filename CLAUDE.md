# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

The NAKA-AI monorepo. Two apps that used to live in separate repos, merged with full history (`git subtree`, 2026-10):

| Path | Was | What it is | Runs on |
|---|---|---|---|
| `apps/landing/` | `kimyohant/naka-ai-landing` | naka-ai.com: public landing, accounts/auth, credits, Stripe billing, receipts, social, inbox, admin. The **account hub** | Worker code on Node in Docker, PostgreSQL schema `account` |
| `apps/studio/` | `kimyohant/naka-drama-studio` | NAKA Studio: the AI production engine (Drama, Marketer, Seller, Product Studio, Viral Clone, Live). Hono backend + Nuxt frontend + Nuxt admin | Docker (service `studio` in the root `docker-compose.yml`) |

Each app keeps its own `package.json`, lockfiles, tests and `CLAUDE.md` — **read the app's own `CLAUDE.md` before working in it**:
- `apps/landing/CLAUDE.md`
- `apps/studio/CLAUDE.md`

There is no shared workspace install: run `npm ci` inside the app (or sub-app: `apps/studio/{backend,frontend,admin}`) you work on.

## How the two apps connect

Members sign in on naka-ai.com; the studio redeems a one-time code from the Worker (SSO). Worker side `apps/landing/src/auth/studio.ts`, studio side `apps/studio/backend/src/auth/naka-sso.ts`, doc `apps/landing/docs/studio-sso.md`. `apps/studio/backend/tests/naka-sso.test.ts` checks the contract against the Worker source in this checkout — change both sides together.

## Commands (from the repo root)

```bash
npm run db:up              # the shared PostgreSQL (Docker)
npm run dev:landing        # landing on 127.0.0.1:8788 (needs apps/landing/.env)
npm run test:landing       # node --test (PostgreSQL in-process via PGlite; no Docker needed)
npm run dev:studio         # studio backend on :5679
npm run dev:studio-web     # studio frontend on :3013
```

CI: `.github/workflows/landing-ci.yml` (with a PostgreSQL service), `studio-ci.yml` and `db-ci.yml` run only when their files change. Deploy: `docker compose up -d --build` at the root (postgres + landing + studio; one app: `docker compose up -d --build studio`). The Cloudflare Worker deploy was retired with D1.

## Shared database (docs/adr/0004)

One PostgreSQL 17 (`docker-compose.yml` at the root, `npm run db:up`) for both apps, one schema per owner: `account` (landing, role `account_app`), `studio` (studio, role `studio_app`), `reporting` (read-only views, `reporting_ro`). Each role's `search_path` is its own schema, so unqualified table names keep working; an app can't read or write the other schema except through views/`SECURITY DEFINER` functions the owner grants. Layout: `infra/postgres/init/` (runs once on an empty volume); permissions are tested with `npm run test:db` (PGlite, no Docker). No RabbitMQ/Redis: queues live in Postgres. Member features (which menus/quotas a plan gives, per-member admin overrides) live in `account` and are read by both apps through SQL functions: `docs/entitlements.md`. Status: Phase 0 (database), Phase 1 (landing) and Phase 2 (studio, `apps/studio/backend/migrations/pg/`) done; both apps' tests run on PGlite. Next: Phase 3 (credit functions, `studio.users` → view, queues on Postgres).

## Architecture decisions

`docs/architecture.md` — the current system map and the decision table for "a feature like this goes here, touches these files", plus the rules that are easy to miss and today's real gaps. Read it before planning a feature that spans the two apps.

`docs/adr/` — 0001 (merge + service boundaries), 0002 (Docker-only platform on the owner's host), 0003 (studio split into per-menu modules — done), 0004 (shared PostgreSQL, no RabbitMQ/Redis). Check them before restructuring.
