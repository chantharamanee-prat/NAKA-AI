## naka-share-card.png

1200 × 630 Open Graph image for the current product-photo-to-sales-video landing. Source: `creative/landing-v2/share-card.html`; regenerate with `node creative/landing-v2/render-share-card.cjs`. It composes existing Naka mascot and fictional sample product assets without inventing customer proof.

## favicon-32.png and apple-touch-icon.png

Raster versions of the Naga-tail `public/logo.svg`. Regenerate after changing the SVG with `node creative/render-brand-icons.cjs`. The lower-left N terminal is a swept fin with a cyan inset so the letter also reads as the character's tail.

## naka-demo-30s.webm, naka-demo-30s.mp4 and naka-demo-poster.jpg

30 s muted, looping 9:16 product demo (540 × 960, 30 fps) used in the review rail card and the Instagram Reels mock on the landing. It walks through the real `/review/` flow (photos → name and real selling points → Naka writes and voices the script → finished clip → channels → try free) and ends on a seamless loop back to frame 0. Code-built motion only, from `soap-campaign.png`, `naka-plush-sales.png` and `logo.svg`, with no AI video. The soap is fictional; the clip says "ตัวอย่าง" on the output and "ตัวอย่างสาธิต · สินค้าสมมติ · ภาพสร้างด้วย AI" on the end card. Source, brief and storyboard are in `creative/demo-film/`; re-render with `node creative/demo-film/render.cjs` (needs Chrome and ffmpeg). Replaced the earlier 7 s `soap-demo-preview.webm` placeholder (added 2026-10-05).

## hero/h3-<id>.mp4 (+ h3-<id>.jpg poster, h3-<id>-box.jpg)

These are 216 × 384, 24 fps, muted H.264 copies of 10 MiniMax H3 clips from `showcase/h3/`: rv-soap-campaign, dr-heir, lv-skincare, bt-packing, rv-coffee, dr-maid, lv-naka-host, bt-cafe, rv-mango and lv-durian. They exist only for the phones on the hero conveyor (`public/hero-line.js`), so the hero never decodes full-size clips inside 112 px phones. At most two phones play at a time.

- `h3-<id>.jpg` is the poster, taken from the first frame so the cut to playback is seamless.
- `h3-<id>-box.jpg` is a 120 × 120 square crop taken at 0.4 s. It is the product shown on that item's box before the machine.

Regenerate one clip with:

```sh
ffmpeg -i showcase/h3/<id>.mp4 -vf scale=216:384:flags=lanczos,fps=24 -an -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 28 -g 24 -movflags +faststart assets/hero/h3-<id>.mp4
```

## naka-sales-world.png

Earlier generated shop-scene exploration. The selected `naka-plush-sales.png` is now used in both the relief mesh and fallback. `naka-world.png` is the source render of the Godot prototype.

Generated on 2026-09-24 using the built-in `image_gen.imagegen` tool, following the imagegen skill. Originals remain under `C:/Users/natta/.codex/generated_images/`. Selected files were copied here for the project.

## naka-plush-sales.png

Selected by the user on 2026-09-26 as option 2 and used in the hero relief and no-WebGL fallback. Generated on 2026-09-25 with the built-in `image_gen.imagegen` tool. The original robotic naga art defined the coiled anatomy and white/cobalt colors. Muse's Veda image was used only as a broad reference for handmade fabric warmth, expressive eyes and a wave. The full-resolution original remains in `C:/Users/natta/.codex/generated_images/01a0d26f-08a0-7633-8ce2-987c8a0c391f/`.

Final prompt:

```text
Use case: style-transfer. Asset type: transparent-background hero mascot cutout for naka-ai, a Thai AI online-selling website. Image 1 is the existing naka-ai naga identity and anatomy; preserve its unmistakable coiled serpent body, upright neck, distinct naga crest and tail, white and cobalt blue palette. Image 2 is only a high-level reference for the cozy hand-crafted plush material, simple friendly face and wave gesture; DO NOT reproduce its human appearance, curly hair, clothing, scarf, skin tone, or exact features. Create an ORIGINAL adorable 3D stuffed-toy naga, premium hand-sewn cotton/velvet texture with subtly visible stitches, rounded chubby head, two large expressive glossy dark-blue eyes with tiny catchlights, a small embroidered friendly smile, short soft fabric crest fins, tiny welcoming front paws (one waving, one presenting a small abstract vertical-video play card), iconic long coiled blue-and-white serpent tail with rounded fins. Adult-friendly character design, warm but credible for Thai merchants. Clean premium studio lighting with soft rim, high legibility at mobile size, front three-quarter view, whole body and tail visible, centered composition. Genuinely transparent background with alpha; no stage, no text, no logos, no extra humans, no exact Muse character elements. 1:1 square image, polished commercial character render.
```

## naka-mascot.png

Identity-preserving cutout from the blue-white robotic naga image supplied by the user. Full body, transparent background, visually inspected for the original character silhouette, visor, crest, coil, and colors.

Final prompt:

```text
Use case: background-extraction
Asset type: naka-ai website hero mascot, square raster cutout.
Input image: the user's attached blue-white robotic Thai naga is the identity reference and edit target.
Primary request: produce a clean isolated high-quality version of exactly this same friendly naga character for a white website hero. Keep its recognisable character, original 3/4 left-facing pose, coiled serpentine body and raised flame-like Thai crest. Keep the pearl-white armor, luminous cobalt-blue and cyan inner body, midnight blue visor with two simple rounded cyan eyes, circular blue ear detail and curling tail. Full body from crest tip through coiled base, generous 6% margins on every edge.
Scene/backdrop: genuinely transparent background with alpha, no simulated checkerboard, no colored rectangle, no scene, no floor plane; only a very subtle soft grounding shadow if transparency supports it.
Style/medium: polished 3D brand mascot, smooth ceramic-like white armor and luminous glass-blue inner surfaces, refined premium friendly technology character. Gentle bright studio lighting that reads well on white.
Constraints: preserve original naga identity and anatomical proportions. It is a Thai naga serpent, no arms, no legs, no wings, no horn redesign, no extra characters, no text, no logo, no watermark. No decorative objects. Actual transparent PNG output requested.
```

## soap-campaign.png

Fictional, AI-generated sample product campaign photograph. Blank packaging; this is demonstration content, not a real seller or testimonial. Visually inspected for clean composition, realistic soap texture, no illegible generated text.

Final prompt:

```text
Use case: product-mockup
Asset type: example generated product campaign photo for naka-ai AI ecommerce website.
Primary request: sophisticated editorial studio product photograph of an artisanal ivory soap bar, showing a believable small-business product elevated into a premium campaign.
Scene/backdrop: seamless pale warm beige background and tabletop; natural ivory travertine stone plinth at center; a single fresh small leafy botanical sprig and soft plant shadows provide texture.
Subject: two solid creamy ivory rectangular handmade soap bars with softly imperfect edges. Main upright bar on the stone block has a simple unprinted pale paper belly band, second bar rests nearby. Main soap occupies center two thirds of image.
Composition/framing: square photograph, three-quarter view, quiet asymmetrical composition balanced for product gallery card cropping. Entire products visible; open upper area. No humans.
Lighting/mood: warm side sunlight from upper left, delicate shadows, tactile realistic material, luxury natural skincare editorial, restrained colors.
Constraints: blank labels without text, no brand marks, no logos, no watermarks, no lettering of any kind. Sharp beautiful soap texture, photographic realism.

## card-drama.jpg, card-live.jpg, card-bot.jpg

1600x900 JPEG cover illustrations added 2026-09-29 for the team service cards
(drama / live / bot), replacing the old CSS-only placeholder art. Generated with
Seedream 5.0 image-to-image using `naka-plush-sales.png` as the identity
reference so the plush naga character stays on-model. Thai-style scenes: film
director set with Thai cinema backdrop (drama), livestream table with mangoes,
jasmine garland and Thai silk (live), chat-helper at a Thai shop counter with
blank speech bubbles (bot). The sales card keeps its video artwork.

## ../showcase/h3/<id>.mp4, <id>.jpg, <id>-from.jpg

Clips for the "Naka Reel" band. Each is rendered with MiniMax H3 (fl2va) on Unsloth Studio from the first frame in `creative/unsloth-reel/shots.json`, then encoded to 540 × 960 H.264 with AAC so the Thai audio H3 generates is kept. `<id>.jpg` is the poster and `<id>-from.jpg` is the exact 9:16 first frame sent to the model, shown as "จากรูปนี้". Regenerate with `node creative/unsloth-reel/generate.cjs` (see the README there). Until clips exist, the band falls back to the demo and drama clips.

## showcase/reel/sky-reel.mp4 and sky-reel.jpg

15 s, 1280 x 720 web copy (H.264 + AAC, faststart) of the "ฟ้าหลังฝน" reel, shown in the home hero's dialog (`public/hero-reel.js`); nothing loads until the visitor presses play. Source is `creative/sky-reel/` (HyperFrames, Apache-2.0): `DESIGN.md` has the concept and beat timeline, `scripts/generate-audio.mjs` writes the score with Node built-ins only. The Thai iced tea photo is the first frame of the library's real "ชาไทยเย็น" clip and the phones show posters of real library clips; the end card says "ตัวอย่างสาธิต · คลิปในมือถือทำด้วยนาคา". Re-render and re-encode (needs Node, Chrome and ffmpeg):

```sh
cd creative/sky-reel && node scripts/generate-audio.mjs && npx hyperframes@0.8.145 render --fps 60 --quality delivery --output out/reel.mp4
ffmpeg -i out/reel.mp4 -vf scale=1280:720:flags=lanczos -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 25 -pix_fmt yuv420p -g 60 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart ../../public/showcase/reel/sky-reel.mp4
ffmpeg -ss 9.6 -i out/reel.mp4 -frames:v 1 -vf scale=1280:720:flags=lanczos -q:v 4 ../../public/showcase/reel/sky-reel.jpg
```

## platforms.svg

SVG sprite of the six sales channels a clip goes to (Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, Shopee, Lazada), used by the hero row and the "ก่อนเริ่ม" section of both home pages through `<use href="/assets/platforms.svg#<id>">`. Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X and Shopee come from Simple Icons 16.35.0 (CC0 1.0) in their brand colours (TikTok and X in the site ink). Simple Icons has no Lazada mark, so Lazada is the Arcticons icon by Donnnno (CC BY-SA 4.0, https://github.com/Arcticons-Team/Arcticons) drawn in Lazada navy; the credit is also in the file. The marks belong to their owners and only name where a clip can be posted.

## showcase/menu/mascot-*.mp4 (+ .jpg posters)

240 x 240 square crops (540 x 540 from y 210, the whole character) of four in-app Naka animations from `showcase/h3/`: anim-writing, anim-voice, anim-rendering and anim-done, muted H.264, about 100 KB each. `public/hero-line.js` puts them on the hero machine as a round screen that runs the studio's steps in turn (กำลังเขียนบท, กำลังพากย์เสียง, กำลังทำคลิป, เสร็จแล้ว!), one whole clip each, after the first 1.2 s and never on save-data or 2g; reduced motion keeps the still plush. Regenerate one with:

```sh
ffmpeg -i showcase/h3/anim-<step>.mp4 -vf "crop=540:540:0:210,scale=240:240:flags=lanczos" -an -c:v libx264 -preset slow -crf 27 -pix_fmt yuv420p -g 24 -movflags +faststart showcase/menu/mascot-<step>.mp4
```
