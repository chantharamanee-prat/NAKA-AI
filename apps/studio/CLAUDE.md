# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in `apps/studio/` of the NAKA-AI monorepo (see the root `CLAUDE.md`).

## Project Overview

NAKA-AI TECH — an all-in-one production tool for AI short dramas / motion comics and product-selling videos. Full TypeScript stack: novel → script rewrite → asset extraction → image generation → storyboard breakdown → video generation → FFmpeg merge & export. Ships as a server deployment (Docker). The Electron desktop app was retired (2026-10); `desktop/` was removed in the monorepo merge.

## Structure

```
backend/   — Hono + Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL; PGlite for dev/tests) + Mastra (AI agents)
backend/workspace/ — Agent working directory (root of the Mastra Workspace jail)
backend/workspace/skills/ — Agent SKILL.md definitions (editable online from /settings)
frontend/  — Nuxt 3 + Vue 3 + TypeScript, ssr:false (plain CSS, no UI framework)
data/      — generated static files (static/) + the dev PGlite database (pglite/, when DATABASE_URL is unset)
study/hypit/ — Full source of Hypit (hypit-ai/hypit @ 7f730ab); the Viral Clone "Hypit" render engine calls it via a CLI subprocess; internal use only, see study/README.md for the license
```

## Commands

### Backend (`backend/`)
- `npm run dev` — tsx watch dev server (port 5679)
- `npm start` — tsx production start
- `npm run typecheck` — TypeScript type check
- `npm run backfill-artwork` — backfill thumbnails and poster frames for existing images/videos

### Tests
- backend: `cd backend && npx tsx --test tests/*.test.ts tests/*.test.mjs`; frontend: `cd frontend && node --test tests/*.test.mjs`
- Backend tests run on PGlite (`DATABASE_URL=pglite://memory`, no Docker). A test that imports `src/core/db` statically starts with `import './_memory-db.js'`; otherwise set the env and `await import(...)` the services. Raw SQL in tests: `tests/_sql.ts` (async `sqlite.prepare(sql).run/get/all`, `columns(table)`, `uniques(table)`)

### Deploy
- Windows server: `scripts\redeploy.ps1` (npm ci, frontend generate, detached restart on 5679; DATABASE_URL from `backend/.env`)
- Docker: the `studio` service of the ROOT `docker-compose.yml` (`docker compose up -d --build studio` at the repo root): DATABASE_URL points at the `postgres` service as `studio_app`; secrets in `apps/studio/.env.production` (template `apps/studio/.env.example`); media/workspace stay in the `naka-drama-studio_naka-data` volume

### Frontend (`frontend/`)
- `npm run dev` — Vite dev server (port 3013, proxies /api and /static to 5679)
- `npm run generate` — produce a static site containing index.html (`.output/public`; `nuxt build` does not emit index.html and cannot be used for static hosting)

## Architecture

### Backend
- **Layout** (docs/adr/0003, root of the monorepo): `src/core/` is shared by every menu (`http`, `auth`, `db`, `ai` + `ai/adapters`, `agents`, `mastra`, `generation`, `production` (episode/storyboard readiness, ffmpeg merge, captions — Product Studio and Viral Clone reuse the drama tables as their timeline), `product`, `tasks`, `utils`, `system`, and the shared `routes`). Each product menu lives in `src/modules/<menu>/` (`drama`, `marketer`, `product-studio`, `seller`, `viral-clone`, `live`, `social`) with `routes/`, `services/`, optional `agent-tools.ts`, and an `index.ts` that exports its `StudioModule` (`core/module.ts`: routes + startup `failStale`/`resume` + `start` for a background timer) plus whatever other menus may use. `src/modules.ts` lists the menus in recovery order. Rules, enforced by `tests/module-boundaries.test.mjs` (in CI): `core/` never imports a menu; a menu imports another menu only via its `index.ts` and only product-studio → marketer, seller → marketer/product-studio, viral-clone → product-studio. New menu = new folder + index.ts + entry in `modules.ts` + `ALLOWED` in that test. Agents owned by a menu get their tools from that menu: `modules/<menu>/agent-tools.ts` calls `registerAgentTools(type, tools)` (core/agents) on import, and the menu's service imports that file before running the agent (tools resolve per request)
- **HTTP**: Hono (entry `src/index.ts`), routes mounted at `/api/v1`, `/static` serves DATA_ROOT, `/admin` 301-redirects to `/settings` (the old back-office address, `?tab=` kept), everything else the frontend build (`FRONTEND_DIST`, default `frontend/dist`, else `frontend/.output/public`)
- **Members (unified system)**: with `NAKA_SSO_URL`/`NAKA_SSO_SECRET` set, members sign in through the naka-ai.com Worker (`apps/landing/src/auth/studio.ts` in this monorepo) — `src/core/auth/naka-sso.ts`. The Worker is the account hub (members, credits, payments, the one admin); this backend is the production engine. SSO off = single-user mode (`'local'`)
- **Per-member data**: `src/core/auth/ownership.ts` (after requireSession) checks every id a request names — path segments and parent ids in query/JSON body — and answers 404 `E_FORBIDDEN_OWNER` for another member's rows. Top-level tables carry `owner_user_id` (stamped on insert from `core/auth/owner-context.ts`, an AsyncLocalStorage scope); children resolve through their parent. List queries add `ownedBy(table.ownerUserId)`. New top-level table → add the column, an `OWNER_SQL`/`PATH_KINDS` entry and the list filter. Admins open anything and list their own + legacy `'local'` rows
- **Member features** (`docs/entitlements.md` at the repo root): `src/core/auth/entitlements.ts` asks the account side (`account.member_features()` / `use_feature()`, granted to `studio_app`) which menus the member's naka-ai plan includes. `entitlementGuard` maps API prefixes to menus (`ROUTE_FEATURES`; shared timeline routes need any menu) → 403 `E_FEATURE_DISABLED`; `generateVideo` counts `studio.video` against the project owner before the task exists (`E_FEATURE_QUOTA`). Off in single-user mode, for admins, and with `NAKA_ENTITLEMENTS=off`. New menu → add it to `ROUTE_FEATURES`, the account migration's `features` and the sidebar's `menuAllowed`. Every menu has a key today, Social Auto Reply (`/api/v1/social`) included: `studio.social`, added by `apps/landing/migrations/pg/0005_studio_social.sql` to every plan that already had `landing.social` (starter and up, not free)
- **System overview**: `GET /api/v1/system/overview` (`src/core/routes/system.ts`, admin only) — version, disk use and per-provider video queues. It is read by the naka-ai back office ("ระบบ Studio", landing `src/admin/studio-system.ts`), which replaced the in-app storage and about/update tabs of the retired desktop app
- **Admin guard**: `src/core/auth/admin.ts` — `ADMIN_TOKEN` (≥ 16 chars, `X-Admin-Token`) or a naka-ai admin session protects the system-settings API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, schema `studio` (docs/adr/0004). `src/core/db/index.ts` picks the driver from `DATABASE_URL` (`postgres://` → postgres.js pool, `pglite://memory|<dir>` → in-process PGlite; unset → `data/pglite`) and exports `db` (Drizzle pg-core), `schema`, `rawQuery`/`rawExec`/`rawTransaction`, `insertedId(rows)`, `pgErrorCode(err)`, `closeDb`. Drizzle on PostgreSQL has no `.get()/.all()/.run()`: `const [row] = await db.select()…`, ids via `.returning({ id })` + `insertedId`, counts via `.returning().length`. Booleans are `true/false`. Adding a migration: a new `backend/migrations/pg/NNNN_name.sql` (applied once at startup under an advisory lock; never edit an applied file) + the matching change in `schema.ts`
- **Concurrency**: every DB call is real I/O now, so a read-then-write can interleave with another request (SQLite + better-sqlite3 made those chains atomic). Use one statement (`ON CONFLICT`, conditional `UPDATE … WHERE … RETURNING`) or a `db.transaction` + `pg_advisory_xact_lock` in which every query goes through `tx` (PGlite has one connection: a query on the global `db` inside an open transaction waits forever). `startTask` (pipeline-tasks) is the per-key mutex most "already running" guards use; `tests/concurrency.test.ts` covers the races
- **Query budget**: every statement is a network round trip, and the episode workbench polls. Read only the rows a request needs (`inArray(…ids)`, never `db.select().from(table)` then filter in JS — that reads every member's rows), run independent reads in one `Promise.all`, batch per-item lookups (`videoQueuePositions`). `tests/query-budget.test.ts` holds the hot endpoints to a statement/row budget against a fixture with other members' data (`queryStats()` from `core/db`, counted on PGlite); filter columns get an index in a migration (`0002_hot_indexes.sql`)
- **Path anchors**: `src/core/utils/paths.ts` resolves DATA_ROOT/STORAGE_ROOT in one place; Docker injects `NAKA_DATA_DIR`/`DATABASE_URL`/`WORKSPACE_PATH`/`FRONTEND_DIST`; dev uses defaults relative to `apps/studio/`
- **AI Agents**: Mastra, 4 agents (script_rewriter / extractor / storyboard_breaker / prompt_generator); instructions are assembled dynamically from `workspace/prompts/*.md` + skills, and the model is resolved per request; a chain of fetch patches adapts to domestic (China) relay providers (disable thinking / temperature / max_tokens)
- **Media generation**: `core/generation/generation.ts` owns the unified task lifecycle (sys_task table), using an adapter pattern: image — openai/gemini/volcengine; video — volcengine/minimax
- **Social Auto Reply** (`modules/social`, spec `.scratch/social-auto-reply/spec.md`, glossary `CONTEXT.md`): a member connects a Facebook Page (OAuth, needs `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` + `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`/`FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`); one poller (`services/poller.ts`, every 5 minutes, started by the module's `start`) reads new comments, cuts them with plain rules (`filter.ts`), asks the `social_responder` agent for a verdict + reply (`responder.ts`) and, in Auto mode, sends it; a person works the rest on the `/social` board (`actions.ts`). Platforms are adapters (`types.ts`, `registry.ts`, `facebook.ts`; tests register `tests/helpers/fake-social-adapter.ts`). A comment changes state in one conditional `UPDATE … RETURNING` (`moveComment`), which is the never-reply-twice guard. `social_accounts` carries `owner_user_id`; posts and comments resolve through their account. Tests: `npm run test:social`
- **Video merge**: `core/production/ffmpeg-merge.ts`; FFmpeg binaries are bundled (ffmpeg-static), overridable via `FFMPEG_BIN`/`FFPROBE_BIN`
- **Hypit render engine**: `services/hypit-render.ts`; when a Viral Clone project has `render_engine='hypit'`, SVML is generated from the beat segments and `study/hypit/bin/hypit.mjs build` is spawned; if unavailable or failing it automatically falls back to the ffmpeg path

### Frontend
- Nuxt 3 SPA; `/` redirects to `/seller` (AI Seller), the drama studio is at `/drama`
- **Menus are Nuxt layers** in `frontend/menus/<menu>/` (same seven names as the backend modules): `pages/`, `views/` (pages with params), `components/`, `utils/`, `locales/{th,en}.json` (that menu's top-level i18n section) and `routes.ts` (its param routes). `menus/index.ts` `MENUS` is the switch: `nuxt.config.ts` extends those layers and registers their `routes.ts` in `pages:extend`. Shared UI stays in `app/` (layouts, base components, composables, plugins, assets, public, shared strings in `app/locales`); `app/composables/i18n.ts` merges `app/locales` with every `menus/*/locales`. Inside a layer `~/` still means `app/`; import another file of the same menu relatively. Frontend tests read merged messages through `tests/_locales.mjs`
- System settings: `app/pages/settings.vue` (`/settings?tab=ai|styles|agents|general|storage|about`, formerly the separate `admin/` app). The sidebar shows its sections to admins only (`session.user.admin`); a signed-in member who is not an admin gets a notice. When the backend answers 401 `E_ADMIN_REQUIRED` (single-user mode with `ADMIN_TOKEN`), `AdminTokenGate` asks for the token once (`composables/useAdminToken.ts`) and `useApi` then sends it as `X-Admin-Token`. "Configure AI" links go to `/settings?tab=ai`; a 401 `E_AUTH_REQUIRED` sends the browser to the naka-ai sign-in
- `app/composables/useApi.ts` is the unified fetch client (all relative paths, same origin as the backend in production)
- Core workbenches: `menus/drama/views/episode.vue` (drama pipeline), `menus/seller/views/workspace.vue` (AI Seller)
- The episode workbench keeps all state and logic in `episode.vue`; its big parts (script, assets, videos, export, task drawer, asset detail) are markup-only lazy chunks in `menus/drama/views/episode/` that `inject(EPISODE_WORKBENCH)` what the page provides. A name a part's template uses must be in the page's `provide(...)` list (`tests/episode-split-structure.test.mjs`). Styles: `views/episode/workbench.css`, plain CSS with every rule under the root `.ep-workbench` (not scoped, so the parts share it)

## Database
PostgreSQL 17 shared with apps/landing (one schema per app, docs/adr/0004). Startup applies `backend/migrations/pg/*.sql` (baseline `0001_baseline.sql` = the former SQLite schema, 39 tables) and seeds style presets (`src/core/db/seed.ts`). Production: root `docker-compose.yml` `postgres` service, backed up with `pg_dump`. Local dev without Docker: leave `DATABASE_URL` unset (PGlite in `data/pglite`), or `npm run db:up` at the root and set `DATABASE_URL=postgres://studio_app:…@127.0.0.1:5432/naka` in `backend/.env`.

## Key Config
- AI service configs are stored in the DB (`ai_service_configs` table) and maintained from `/settings` (admins only), not in config files
- `ADMIN_TOKEN`: guards the system-settings API (`backend/src/core/auth/admin.ts`); admin-only calls need `X-Admin-Token`. The app keeps open reads (AI config list without keys, style presets) and `/settings/*` user prefs
- The full list of environment variables is in the README ("环境变量" section)
- `PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Seedance needs a public address to reference local assets
